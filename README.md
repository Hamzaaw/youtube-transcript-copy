## 💡 Why I built this

I watch a lot of long-form YouTube content (like interviews, lectures, and podcasts), and often use AI to summarize or analyze the transcript.

But copying transcripts manually from YouTube is a hassle:
- You have to scroll forever
- Manually select everything
- Deal with a clunky UI and inconsistent formatting

This extension removes all that friction — no clutter, no popups, just one click to grab what you need.
